This initially started out as an earlyish Janus config, before I started working on my own setup. There are still a few bits left lying around from those days.\r\n\r\nI now use Vundle to manage the Vim scripts that I use - the list of scripts used is kept in vundle-bundles.vim.\r\n\r\nI mainly use MacVim, so a lot of the configuration reflects this, but where necessary I take into account Windows and Vim without scripting language support (i.e. Vim compiled without Ruby or Python).\r\n","tagline":"My Vim configuration","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
